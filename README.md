# ProducerConsumer
This is some basic code to help learn new stuff amnd demonstrate concepts in my log.
It is comprised of a message produce amd a message consumer.
Nothing fancy going on. Just sending messages via a Redis queue and consuming them on the console, of the consumer. However each branch will have a new concept added. 

## Architecture
The architecture is quite simple. Both producer and consumer connect to a Redis DB. I put my Redis DB on a Linux VM.
